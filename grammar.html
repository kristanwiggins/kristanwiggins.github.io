         <p>There are some people who just don't know grammar. There are some people who think they know grammar but don't. There are some people who know grammar and use it correctly in their everyday lives. </p>
            <p>And then there's me.</p>
            <p>For the past three years or so, I've been elbows deep in grammar for the better part of my work weeks. I'm a copy editor. Night in and night out, I read over articles for content, sure, fact-checking, definitely, but grammar and style most of all.</p>
            <p>This definitely won't account for all the grammar you need to know, but it will help rookies out there from making their namesake mistakes.</p>
            <h2>A copy editor's guide to preventing you from making said copy editor scoff and then rip her hair out</h2>
            <h3>1. Become best friends with your dictionary</h3>
            <p> I cannot stress this enough: Know what words mean before throwing them in your writing willy nilly. </p>
            <p>Fight the urge to throw in (formerly) SAT-friendly words such as <em>abrogate</em> when you could easily replace it <em>cancel</em> or <em>deny</em>.</p>
            <h3>2. Know when to use commonly confused words</h3>
            <p>There are too many word groups/pairs that people misue to list this all here, but here are the ones I find most inexcusable:</p>
            <ul id="grammar">
                <li>It's and its: the first is the contraction while the other signifies possession</li>
                <li>You're and your: *see above</li>
                <li>They're, their and there: like above, the first is the contraction, the second is the possession and the third indicates place</li>
                <li>Then and than: Use the first when talking about timing of events and the second with comparisons</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Others to look out for: like vs. such as; more than vs. over; fewer vs. less; who vs. whom;lay vs. lie; who vs. that vs. which.</p>
            <h3>3. Make  subjects, pronouns and verbs agree</h3>
            <p>Most people can get this right just playing it by ear. Plural subjects need the plural form of verbs, and singular subjects need the singural verbs. <em>She cooks.</em> but <em>They cook</em>. Where people mess up, from what I've noticed, is with ambiguous nouns, or nouns that are singular but techinically mean multiple people or things. <em>Group</em> means multiple people but is a singular noun and therefore takes a singular verb and pronoun. The <em>group</em> of council members <em>made</em> <em>its</em> decision.</p>
            <h3>4. Ignore what sounds right in certain situations</h3>
            <p>Just because you hear people say certain things, that doesn't mean they are correct. <em>Irregardless</em> isn't a word. <em>I could care less</em> means you do care at least a little bit. <em>Should of</em> isn't the right way to expand the contraction <em> should've</em>.</p>
            <h3>5. Learn to let go of filler words and redudant phrasing</h3>
            <p>This rule is more of a guideline, albeit a useful one, especially for journalists. Writing short can be a journalist's best friend on deadline, and often results in a better story. There are two basic ways to do this. 1. Avoid passive voice: Not only does passive make your writing vague and lacking actors, but it also cut down on words. Compare: The painting was stolen by a smuggler. A smuggler stole the painting. 2. Avoid redudancies: 12 p.m. noon (when else would noon be?), 7 a.m. in the morning, first debut album (debut means first).
            <h3>6. Pick a style and follow it</h3>
            <p>Personally, I've always followed the Associated Press Stylebook to figure out how to write out addresses and whether I write ten or 10. Others use Chicago, and others use a combination of personal and established styles. Whatever you use, stick to it throughout.</p>
            <h3>7. When in doubt, look it up</h3>
            <p>I haven't met anyone who's claimed to know everything grammar and style related like the back of his or her hand. There's nothing wrong in looking up that pesky hyphenation rule, or what obdurate actually means. Let your fingers do the walking flipping through that book or typing across that keyboard!</p>
