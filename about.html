                <h2>Well, hi there.</h2>
                <p>I got the story bug early on in life. I would find myself finishing my work early or staying in from recess just so I could read in a bright red, claw-footed tub filled with pillows in the back of my elementary school classroom.</p>
                <p>I decided I wanted to be a writer soon after and started work on the first of many unfinished novels at the age of 8. Clack, clack-clack, ding! — this was the sound my mom’s old typewriter made when I finished a line of my first attempted book. Fourth-grade me had it in her head she’d be the next J.K. Rowling. </p>
            <p>As I grew up, I became more realistic about my prospects as a novelist — there’ll only ever be one billionaire author and that spot’s taken. (Ironically enough, author recently ranked higher than last-place reporter on a list of 200 career choices). However, I never lost the interest in storytelling.</p>
            <p>Long story short, life happened and my direction changed. I decided to take my authorial dreams and apply them to journalism by joining my high school newspaper.</p>
            <p>At first this choice was a hard one. I saw news as dry and uninviting — although I always knew news was of utmost importance for a civilized, informed society. I believe the job of any journalist is to make people take the time out of their busy day to just read. And in order to do that, you have to be a storyteller.</p>

                <p>Now you might have noticed that I’m a political science major as well. When I was just a budding journalist in high school, I had no idea what I wanted to accomplish. All I knew was that I was a good writer and that I wanted to help communicate the news to the public. </p>
            <p>After studying American government, I realized that what was going on in Washington, state legislatures and even local city commissions were really important. It all shaped everyday life. So, taking this and my suppressed-by-journalistic-objectivity activism, I developed my interest in political news.</p>
